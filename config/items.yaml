# OSRS Signals - Item Selection Configuration
# 
# This file controls which items are selected for forecasting based on
# trading volume and data continuity criteria, with manual override options.

# Automatic selection criteria
auto_select:
  # Number of top items to select based on ranking criteria
  top_n: 10
  
  # Minimum days of data required (out of lookback_days period)
  min_days: 10  # Minimum continuity requirement
  
  # Minimum median daily volume threshold (units traded per day)
  min_volume: 1000  # 1K units minimum (relaxed for demo)
  
  # Minimum coverage percentage (days_with_data / lookback_days * 100)
  # Items must have data on at least this % of days in the lookback period
  min_coverage_pct: 2.0  # 2% coverage minimum (relaxed for demo with sparse data)
  
  # Lookback period for analysis (days)
  lookback_days: 365

# Manual overrides
# Items in manual_include will always be selected (if they meet min_days requirement)
manual_include: []  # e.g., [4151, 561] for specific item IDs

# Items in manual_exclude will never be selected, even if they rank highly
manual_exclude: []

# Name-based overrides (additive to ID-based ones above)
# Items matching these names will be included/excluded (case-insensitive exact match)
manual_include_names:
  - "Dragon claws"
  - "Armadyl godsword"
  - "Twisted bow"

manual_exclude_names: []  # e.g., ["Coins", "Fire cape"]

# Example manual overrides:
# manual_include:
#   - 4151  # Abyssal whip - always include
#   - 561   # Nature rune - always include
# 
# manual_exclude:
#   - 995   # Coins - exclude (not a tradeable item)
#   - 6570  # Fire cape - exclude (untradeable)

# ============================================================================
# Ingestion Configuration
# ============================================================================
# Controls which items are fetched during data ingestion.
# Priority order: selected items → includes → auto-discover → emergency seed

ingest_targets:
  # Items to always include (by ID)
  include_ids: []  # e.g., [995, 4151] for specific items
  
  # Items to always include (by name, case-insensitive)
  include_names: ["Dragon claws", "Armadyl godsword", "Twisted bow"]  # High-value PvP items
  
  # Items to always exclude from ingestion (by ID)
  exclude_ids: []  # e.g., [995] to skip Coins
  
  # Items to always exclude from ingestion (by name)
  exclude_names: []  # e.g., ["Coins", "Platinum token"]
  
  # Auto-discovery: fetch high-volume items based on GE buy limits
  auto_discover:
    enabled: true  # Set to false to disable auto-discovery
    top_k: 10  # Number of items to auto-discover
    min_limit: 1000  # Minimum GE buy limit (proxy for liquidity)
    members_only: null  # null = both, true = members only, false = F2P only

# Runtime caps to prevent excessive API usage
runtime_caps:
  max_items_per_run: 25  # Maximum items to fetch per ingestion run
  request_sleep_ms: 450  # Sleep between item requests (milliseconds)
